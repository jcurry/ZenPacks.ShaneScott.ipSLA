ZenPacks.ShaneScott.ipSLA
=========================


Description
===========

This ZenPack gathers information about Cisco IP SLAs.  It has a modeler (SLA) that discovers such components
and several component templates that automatically bind to the SLA components to provide performance data.


Note that the component templates are NOT named identically to the component but specify within the SLAs.py code
that the component template for automatic binding, shall reflect rttMonCtrlAdminRttType.  In practise,
this means templates called Echo, HTTP, Jitter and New_SLA.

The SLAs component is created as a subclass of the existing OSComponent class.  No new device object class
is created and the __init__.py declares the relationship between the new SLAs component and the OperatingSystem
component.

A new device class, /Network/Cisco/IPSLA is created with modeler plugins assigned, including the SLA modeler.

Requirements & Dependencies
===========================

* Zenoss Versions Supported: 4.x - tested against Zenoss Core 4.2.5 SUP 457
* External Dependencies:
* ZenPack Dependencies:
* Installation Notes: Restart zenoss
  Note that you may get a message saying "Some unknown problem occured adding device class /Network/Cisco/IPSLA". This appears to be benign and the class is actually added.
* Configuration: none needed, put your device into /Network/Cisco/IPSLA, the modeler will discover the SLA instances as components and start graphing them.
